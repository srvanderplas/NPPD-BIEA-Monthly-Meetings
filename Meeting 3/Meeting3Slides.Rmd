# The Grammar of Graphics

## Resources
- [A nice explanation](https://ramnathv.github.io/pycon2014-r/visualize/ggplot2.html) of the grammar of graphics
- [`ggplot2` reference](http://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/) (documentation, function references)
- [Elegant graphics for data analysis](https://www.springer.com/us/book/9780387981413) (Hadley Wickham's book on `ggplot2`)
- [Graphics in R](https://srvanderplas.github.io/NPPD-Analytics-Workshop/02.Graphics/02.guide.html) (Training materials from last years' R workshops)

## The Grammar of Graphics

- A system for describing graphics
- Breaks the plot down into the following components:
    - Aesthetics: map a variable to something with a scale (x, y, color, shape)
    - Geometries: geometric objects displayed on the chart (point, line, ribbon, rectangle)
    - Scales: control the details of how aesthetics are displayed

## The Grammar of Graphics

- A layer is a set of 

    1. data
    2. a mapping of aesthetics
    3. a geometry

- Each plot is made up of one or more layers

## The Grammar of Graphics

(Made up data) Number of people on-site at CNS:
```{r echo = T, fig.width = 6, fig.height = 4}
data <- data_frame(
  time = seq(0, 23, 1),
  onsite = c( 30,  30,  30,  30,  45, 156, 
             435, 530, 550, 552, 550, 555,
             555, 543, 400, 314, 203,  85,
              45,  42,  32,  30,  30,  30)
)
```

## The Grammar of Graphics
```{r echo = F, fig.width = 6, fig.height = 4}
qplot(xmin = time, xmax = time + 1, ymin = 0, ymax = onsite, 
      geom = "rect", data = data, fill = I("grey"), color = I("black")) + 
  xlab("Time of Day") + ylab("# Onsite")
```

What are the aesthetics? What are the geometric objects?

qplot(xmin = time, xmax = time + 1, ymin = 0, ymax = onsite, 
      geom = "rect", data = data, fill = I("grey"), color = I("black")) + 
  xlab("Time of Day") + ylab("# Onsite")
```

```{r echo = F, fig.width = 6, fig.height = 4, message = F, warning = F}
qplot(x = time, y = onsite, 
      geom = "line", data = data, color = I("black")) + 
  xlab("Time of Day") + ylab("# Onsite")
```

      geom = "ribbon", data = data, fill = I("grey"), color = I("black")) + 
  xlab("Time of Day") + ylab("# Onsite")
```

## `ggplot2`

`ggplot2` has two main plotting functions: `qplot` (quickplot) and `ggplot`. 

We'll use the diamonds dataset included with `ggplot2` to demonstrate.

qplot makes assumptions about the geometric objects you want:

```{r echo = T, eval = F}
qplot(carat, price, data = diamonds)
```

ggplot is more precise and can be customized much more extensively

```{r echo = T, eval = F}
ggplot(data = diamonds) + 
  geom_point(aes(x = carat, y = price))
```

## `ggplot2`

Transformations, annotations, and additional layers can be added to both qplot and ggplot using `+`:


```{r echo = T, eval = F}
qplot(carat, price, data = diamonds) + 
  geom_smooth() + 
  scale_y_log10() + 
  ggtitle("Price of diamonds by weight in carats")


ggplot(data = diamonds) + 
  geom_point(aes(x = carat, y = price)) + 
  geom_smooth(aes(x = carat, y = price)) + 
  scale_y_log10() + 
  ggtitle("Price of diamonds by weight in carats")
```

## `ggplot2`

```{r echo = F, eval = T, fig.width = 6, fig.height = 4}
qplot(carat, price, data = diamonds) + 
  geom_smooth() + 
  scale_y_log10() + 
  ggtitle("Price of diamonds by weight in carats")
```

## `ggplot2`

```{r echo = T, eval = T, fig.width = 4, fig.height = 4}
ggplot(data = diamonds, aes(x = factor(1), fill = color)) + 
  geom_bar(width = 1, color = "black")
```

## `ggplot2`

```{r echo = T, eval = T, fig.width = 4, fig.height = 4}
ggplot(data = diamonds, aes(x = factor(1), fill = color)) + 
  geom_bar(width = 1, color = "black") + 
  coord_polar(theta = 'y')
```

## Maps in `ggplot2`

Maps provide an easy way to demonstrate the differences between aesthetics, geometric objects, layers, and scales.

```{r echo = T, include = 2, message = F}
states <- map_data("state")
head(states)
```

## Maps in `ggplot2`

What is needed to plot a basic map?

- latitude/longitude points for boundaries
- which boundary group the points belong to (e.g. state or region of a state)
- the order to connect the points

## A basic map

What "geom" (geometric object) is used in this plot?

```{r echo = T}
qplot(long, lat, data = states)
```

## Order matters

What "geom" (geometric object) is used in this plot?

```{r echo = F}
qplot(long, lat, geom = "line", data = states) + coord_map()
```

## A basic map


What "geom" (geometric object) is used in this plot?
```{r echo = F}
qplot(long, lat, geom = "path", group = group, data = states) + coord_map()
```

## A basic map

What "geom" (geometric object) is used in this plot?

```{r echo = F}
qplot(long, lat, group = group, 
      fill = I("white"), color = I("black"), 
      geom = "polygon", data = states) + coord_map()
```

## A basic map

Polygons have filled inside space; lines just define the perimeter

```{r echo = T, eval = F}
qplot(long, lat, group = group, 
      fill = I("white"), color = I("black"), 
      geom = "polygon", data = states) + coord_map()
```

## Adding aesthetics

We can add additional data to a map by joining state-level information to the map coordinates.

```{r echo = T}
statereg <- read.csv("https://bit.ly/2i0AFHK")
head(statereg)
```

## Adding aesthetics

```{r echo = T}
state.class <- left_join(states, statereg, by = c("region" = "State"))
head(state.class)
```

## Adding aesthetics

```{r echo = T}
qplot(long, lat, geom = "polygon", data = state.class, 
      group = group, fill = StateGroups, color = I("black")) + 
  coord_map() 
```

## Example: Coursera Progress

```{r echo = T, message = F, warning = F}
library(stringr) # Work with strings
library(lubridate) # Work with dates
library(tidyr) # Clean up data

csvs <- list.files("\\\\cgownt08\\Common\\BI Embedded Agents", "*.csv", 
                   full.names = T)

progress <- lapply(csvs, function(x) {
  tmp <- read.csv(x, stringsAsFactors = F)
  date <- str_extract(x, "\\d{4}-\\d{2}-\\d{2}") %>% ymd()
  
  tmp$date <- date
  tmp
}) 

```

## Example: Coursera Progress

```{r echo = T, message = F, warning = F}
progress <- progress %>%
  bind_rows() %>%
  filter(!External.Id %in% c("cabaler", "gajaspe", "kmhelgo")) %>%
  select(Name, Course, Overall.Progress, Completed, date) %>%
  # Add in 0s for all combinations of Name, Course, and date that don't appear
  complete(Name, Course, date, fill = list(Overall.Progress = 0, Completed = "No")) %>%
  # Clean up a bit
  mutate(
    Overall.Progress = ifelse(Completed == "Yes", 100, Overall.Progress),
    Course = str_replace(Course, "The Data Scientist(.*)", 
                         "The Data Scientist's Toolbox") %>%
      factor(levels = c("The Data Scientist's Toolbox", "R Programming", 
                        "Getting and Cleaning Data", "Exploratory Data Analysis",
                        "Reproducible Research")))
```

## Example: Coursera Progress

```{r echo = T, eval = T}
ggplot(data = progress) + 
  geom_line(aes(x = date, y = Overall.Progress, group = Name)) + 
  facet_wrap(~Course)
```


## Example: Coursera Progress

<div class = "columns-2">
```{r echo = F, fig.width = 4, fig.height = 6}
ggplot(data = progress) + 
  geom_line(aes(x = date, y = Overall.Progress, group = Name)) + 
  facet_wrap(~Course, nrow = 3)
```

One line per person per course

Most people

- were done with Course 1 before I started logging data
- have completed Course 2 and are on Course 3 or 4

</div>

## Example: Coursera Progress

```{r echo = T}
ggplot(data = progress) + 
  geom_line(aes(x = date, y = Overall.Progress, color = Name)) + 
  facet_wrap(~Course)
```


## Example: Coursera Progress

```{r echo = T}
ggplot(data = progress) + 
  geom_line(aes(x = date, y = Overall.Progress, color = Course)) + 
  facet_wrap(~Name)
```

## Example: Coursera Progress

```{r echo = T, fig.width = 8, fig.height = 5, eval = F}
ggplot(data = progress) + 
  geom_ribbon(aes(x = date, ymin = 0, ymax = Overall.Progress, fill = Course),
              color = "black") + 
  facet_wrap(~Name, nrow = 3, ncol = 5) + 
  theme(legend.position = "bottom")
```

## Example: Coursera Progress

```{r echo = F, fig.width = 8, fig.height = 5, eval = T}
ggplot(data = progress) + 
  geom_ribbon(aes(x = date, ymin = 0, ymax = Overall.Progress, fill = Course),
              color = "black") + 
  facet_wrap(~Name, nrow = 3, ncol = 5) + 
  theme(legend.position = "bottom")
```


## Example: Coursera Progress

```{r echo = T, eval = F}
ggplot(data = progress) + 
  geom_ribbon(aes(x = date, ymin = 0, ymax = Overall.Progress, fill = Course),
              color = "black") + 
  facet_wrap(~Name) + 
  guides(fill = guide_legend(nrow = 2)) + 
  theme(legend.position = c(1, 0), legend.justification = c(1, 0)) + 
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Paired")
  
```


## Example: Coursera Progress
```{r echo = F, fig.width = 8, fig.height = 5}
ggplot(data = progress) + 
  geom_ribbon(aes(x = date, ymin = 0, ymax = Overall.Progress, fill = Course)) + 
  facet_wrap(~Name) + 
  guides(fill = guide_legend(nrow = 2)) + 
  theme(legend.position = c(1, 0), legend.justification = c(1, 0)) + 
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Paired")
  
```



# Q&A

## What R questions do you have for me?

# Announcements

## Next Week

Weather permitting, I will be in Columbus next week for the R Study Group (Wednesday, Feb 21, 8:30 - 9:30).

## Announcement

<div class = "columns-2">

I have taken a research job at Iowa State University, starting March 1

I will be researching statistical methods for forensics:

- bullet matching
- handwriting analysis
- shoe print matching
- jury response to data and graphics

</div>

## Wait, What?

- I will still be supporting the BIEA program at NPPD part time
    - I will probably be less available during business hours
    - I'm planning to check in most evenings after I put my son to bed    
    I'll adjust this after I get some sort of routine going long-term
- I will still be available on Slack (even during the day) and reachable by email
    - You can also call my cell phone (515) 509-6613 with urgent questions
- Jason and I are committed to keeping this program going!

## So what now?

- Start by asking around to see if other embedded agents can help
    - People with prior programming/data experience:    
    Scott 1, Scott 2, Derek, Mike, Ron, Lourdes
- Post to slack with your problem (Reproducible Examples, please!)
- Email Susan (I will hopefully check email at least once a day)

## Happy Valentine's Day!

```{r valentine, echo = F, fig.width = 4, fig.height = 4, fig.align = "center"}
rfunc <- function(z) {
  2 - 2*sin(z) + sin(z) * sqrt(abs(cos(z))) / (sin(z) + 1.4)
}

theta <- seq(0, 2*pi, length.out = 500)
